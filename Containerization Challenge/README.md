This exercise will be to create a container to run full screen Mario. You will need to create a docker file that downloads and extract the zip file. Then with NGINX, configure it to point to the index.html file.

To unzip the package inside the image you will need to install the unzip package. The package can be found at: https://archive.org/download/FullScreenMarioSourceCode/FullScreenMario-master.zip
